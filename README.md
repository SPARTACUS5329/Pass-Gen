# Pass-Gen

**Problems**

1. It is very hard to remember all passwords
2. It is not safe to have the same password for every account
3. Even if they are different, they are not very safe because they are usually related

**Solutions**

1. You need to remember only one master password
2. The passwords will be dependent on the website
3. The passwords will be pre-hashed

**Setup**

1. Download the zip and expand it
2. Open `chrome://extensions` on Google Chrome
3. Turn on Developer Mode
4. Click on Load Unpacked and select the folder
5. Pin the extension if you want to by clicking on the extensions icon

**Usage**

1. Enter a master password that will be the same for every account
2. Enter the service i.e the website's name for which you need the password
3. Click on Generate
4. There will be an alert on the browser which will contain your password
5. Copy it and use it

**Extra advantage**: You don't need to store your passwords anywhere

**Note**: Longer the master password, stronger the hash
